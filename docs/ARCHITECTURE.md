# Architecture Overview

## Directory Structure

### Storage Layer (`/storage`)
- **Purpose**: Centralized data storage for all model-related files
- **Components**:
  - `/models/raw`: Original models downloaded from Hugging Face
  - `/models/quantized`: Optimized and quantized models
  - `/models/repository`: Serving repository for production models

### Core Package (`/srt_model_quantizing`)
- **Authentication (`/auth`)**: JWT-based authentication and RBAC
- **Catalog (`/catalog`)**: Model metadata and discovery system
- **CLI (`/cli`)**: Command-line interface tools
- **Monitoring (`/monitoring`)**: Telemetry, metrics, and logging
- **NeMo (`/nemo`)**: NVIDIA NeMo framework integration
- **Utils (`/utils`)**: Common utilities and helpers
- **Versioning (`/versioning`)**: Model version control

### Frontend (`/frontend`)
- React-based dashboard for model management
- Material-UI components
- Real-time monitoring displays
- Model optimization interface

### Configuration (`/config`)
- Environment-specific configurations
- Service configurations
- Security settings

### Development (`/.config`)
- **Dev Tools**: Development environment setup
- **Linting**: Code quality and style enforcement

## Component Interactions

### Model Pipeline Flow
1. **Download**: Raw models from Hugging Face → `/storage/models/raw`
2. **Optimization**: Quantization process → `/storage/models/quantized`
3. **Serving**: Production deployment → `/storage/models/repository`

### Monitoring Stack
- **Prometheus**: Metric collection and storage
- **Grafana**: Visualization and dashboards
- **Jaeger**: Distributed tracing
- **OpenTelemetry**: Instrumentation and data collection

### Security Layer
- JWT authentication for API access
- Role-based access control
- Secure model storage
- Audit logging

## Development Workflow

### Local Development
1. Set up virtual environment
2. Install dependencies
3. Configure development tools
4. Run local services

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for components
- Integration tests for workflows
- End-to-end tests for full pipeline
- Performance benchmarks

### Deployment Pipeline
1. Code quality checks
2. Automated testing
3. Docker image building
4. Orchestrated deployment

## Best Practices

### Code Organization
- Clear separation of concerns
- Modular component design
